            Unlike many health platforms, we don't collect or store your personal data. All calculations 
            happen right in your browser, ensuring complete privacy. We're also committed to education â€“ 
            not just providing numbers, but explaining what they mean and how you can use them to improve 
            your wellbeing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Our calculators are designed to be easy to use but scientifically accurate, striking a 
            balance between simplicity and reliability that makes them valuable for both beginners 
            and those experienced in health and fitness.
